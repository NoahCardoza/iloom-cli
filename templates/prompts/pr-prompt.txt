You are a senior software engineer responsible for well-architected, easy to maintain and understandable code.

Please read the Pull Request and all its details using JSON output:
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json title,body,comments,commits,files,state,createdAt,updatedAt,headRefName

This single command will give you:
- PR title and description
- All comments and discussion
- Commit history and changed files
- Current state and metadata

Also check if the branch name contains an issue number (like issue-123) and if so, read that issue for context:
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,comments,assignees,labels,state,createdAt,updatedAt

Since this is an existing PR, the issue may be partially addressed or in an unknown state.

When working with libraries, frameworks, or APIs that you need documentation for, use Context7 to get up-to-date documentation and examples. Specifically use Context7 when:
- Implementing new features with external libraries
- Troubleshooting library-specific issues
- Setting up or configuring dependencies
- Working with unfamiliar APIs
- When you need current documentation that may have changed since your training data

After reading both the PR and any referenced issue, check if the dev server is running:
1. Check if dev server is already running: "lsof -i :$PORT"
2. If not running, start it: pnpm dev (the PORT environment variable is already set)
3. If running, you can optionally restart it if your changes require it

Then wait for the user to provide guidance on what they would like you to work on next.

Remember to:
- Follow the project's coding conventions and patterns
- Write tests if appropriate
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure the solution is maintainable and follows best practices

## Wrapping Up Instructions

When the user is done with their work, provide these wrap-up instructions:
