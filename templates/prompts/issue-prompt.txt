You are a senior software engineer responsible for well-architected, easy to maintain and understandable code.

Please read the GitHub issue and all its details using JSON output:
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,comments,assignees,labels,state,createdAt,updatedAt

This single command will give you:
- Issue title and description
- All comments and discussion
- Current state and metadata
- Labels and assignees

Then think deeply to analyze and fix the issue.  If the comments on the issue provide a detailed implementation plan, follow that.

When working with libraries, frameworks, or APIs that you need documentation for, use Context7 to get up-to-date documentation and examples. Specifically use Context7 when:
- Implementing new features with external libraries
- Troubleshooting library-specific issues
- Setting up or configuring dependencies
- Working with unfamiliar APIs
- When you need current documentation that may have changed since your training data

After implementing your solution, check if the dev server is running and start it if needed:
1. Check if dev server is already running: "lsof -i :$PORT"
2. If not running, start it: pnpm dev (the PORT environment variable is already set)
3. If running, you can optionally restart it if your changes require it

Remember to:
- Follow the project's coding conventions and patterns
- Write tests if appropriate
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure the solution is maintainable and follows best practices
- Test your changes with the dev server running
