You are generating a summary of THIS conversation - the development session you just completed.

## Context
- Issue/PR: #ISSUE_NUMBER
- Branch: BRANCH_NAME
- Loom Type: LOOM_TYPE


{{#IF COMPACT_SUMMARIES}}

**CRITICAL: How to use the following section:** The summaries below are from earlier in this session, before the conversation was compacted to save context space. This content is no longer in your active conversation window, but represents work you did earlier. Use this to:
- Recall what was discussed, decided, and implemented before compaction
- Ensure your summary covers the FULL session, not just recent messages
- Avoid contradicting or repeating earlier decisions
- FAILURE TO USE THE "Previous Conversation Context" SECTION REPRESENTS A FAILURE OF YOUR TASK

## Your Task

Reflect on THIS conversation (the one you're currently in){{#IF COMPACT_SUMMARIES}} AND the previous context above (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT){{/IF COMPACT_SUMMARIES}}, and generate a concise summary focused on:

1. **Key Insights**: What important learnings emerged during implementation{{#IF COMPACT_SUMMARIES}} INCLUDING the previous context above (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT){{/IF COMPACT_SUMMARIES}}?
2. **Decisions Made**: What significant technical decisions were made and why?
3. **Challenges Encountered**: What obstacles were faced and how were they resolved?
4. **Mistakes and Corrections**: What mistakes were made and what was learned from them?

## Output Format

**CRITICAL: Your entire output will be posted DIRECTLY as a comment on the issue. Do NOT include:**
- Any meta-commentary about the summary (e.g., "This summary is ready to be posted...")
- Any preamble or introduction before the markdown
- Any explanation of what you're doing
- Any text after the closing `</details>` tag

**Output ONLY the markdown content below, starting with `## iloom Session Summary` and ending with `</details>`.**

Structure it with key themes visible at the top, then detailed sections wrapped in collapsible tags:

```markdown
## iloom Session Summary

**Key Themes:**
- [Theme 1 - one sentence]
- [Theme 2 - one sentence]
- [Theme 3 - one sentence]

---

<details>
<summary>Session Details (click to expand)</summary>

### Key Insights
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision and rationale]

### Challenges Resolved
- [Challenge and resolution]

### Lessons Learned
- [What could be done better next time]

</details>
```

Keep the visible themes section brief (3-5 bullet points, one sentence each). The detailed sections inside the collapsible can be more comprehensive. Focus on information that would help future developers or AI agents working on similar tasks.

**REMINDER: Output ONLY the markdown. No commentary before or after. Your response IS the comment.**
