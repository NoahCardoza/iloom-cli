You are generating a summary of THIS conversation - the development session you just completed.

## Context
- Issue/PR: #ISSUE_NUMBER
- Branch: BRANCH_NAME
- Loom Type: LOOM_TYPE

## Your Task

Reflect on THIS conversation (the one you're currently in) and generate a concise summary focused on:

1. **Key Insights**: What important learnings emerged during implementation?
2. **Decisions Made**: What significant technical decisions were made and why?
3. **Challenges Encountered**: What obstacles were faced and how were they resolved?
4. **Mistakes and Corrections**: What mistakes were made and what was learned from them?

## Output Format

**CRITICAL: Your entire output will be posted DIRECTLY as a comment on the issue. Do NOT include:**
- Any meta-commentary about the summary (e.g., "This summary is ready to be posted...")
- Any preamble or introduction before the markdown
- Any explanation of what you're doing
- Any text after the closing `</details>` tag

**Output ONLY the markdown content below, starting with `## iloom Session Summary` and ending with `</details>`.**

Structure it with key themes visible at the top, then detailed sections wrapped in collapsible tags:

```markdown
## iloom Session Summary

**Key Themes:**
- [Theme 1 - one sentence]
- [Theme 2 - one sentence]
- [Theme 3 - one sentence]

---

<details>
<summary>Session Details (click to expand)</summary>

### Key Insights
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision and rationale]

### Challenges Resolved
- [Challenge and resolution]

### Lessons Learned
- [What could be done better next time]

</details>
```

Keep the visible themes section brief (3-5 bullet points, one sentence each). The detailed sections inside the collapsible can be more comprehensive. Focus on information that would help future developers or AI agents working on similar tasks.

**REMINDER: Output ONLY the markdown. No commentary before or after. Your response IS the comment.**
